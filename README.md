# VCard PHP class

This VCard PHP class can generate a vCard with some data. When using an iOS device it will export as a .ics file because iOS devices don't support the default .vcf files.


## Documentation

The class is well documented inline. If you use a decent IDE you'll see that each method is documented with PHPDoc.


## Contributing

It would be great if you could help us improve this class. GitHub does a great job in managing collaboration by providing different tools, the only thing you need is a [GitHub](http://github.com) login.
